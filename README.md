# Thermostat App
This is a frontend javascript web app. The user is able to increase and decrease the temperature of the thermostat. The temperature is displayed in colours relating to the energy usage: green for low, white for medium and red for high energy usage. The user is able to switch on and off power saving mode, which limits the maximum temperature.
